*Use Template Pattern to achieve Liskov Subs principle/Open CLosed Principle/Single Responsibility Principle/Interface Seg Principle.

We are demonstrating Liskov-Sub Principle and Interface Seg Principle in following Vehicle example
Classes and Interfaces being used
--------------------------------
1) Two Interfaces defining specific Methods (Also Interface Seg Principle) NormalVehicle and Electric Vehicle
2) Concrete Classes NormalCar and Electric Car Implementing specific interfaces.
3) Client Code to interact with Concrete Classes
4) Template Pattern Allows to create separate Templates(Specific Interfaces) as per need
