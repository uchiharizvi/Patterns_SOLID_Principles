*Use Template Pattern to achieve Liskov Subs principle/Open CLosed Principle/Single Responsibility Principle/Interface Seg Principle.

We are demonstrating Liskov-Sub Principle in following Vehicle example
Classes and Interfaces being used
--------------------------------
1) Class InsertionSort,MergeSort or any new Functionality needs to be extended(Open)
2) Interface Sorted(To be implemented by every new functionality)
3) Class SorterManager responsible to interact with sorted interface
4) Client code responsible to interact with SorterManager
